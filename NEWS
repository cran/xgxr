CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.5
-------------------------
    o fixed bug in xgx_theme_set() to make sure it calls xgx_theme() instead of theme_bw()
    o fixed bug in xgx_stat_ci() which changed default geom properties globally by mistake

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.4
-------------------------
    o fixed bug in xgx_geom_ci because it wasn't properly passing parameters to xgx_stat_ci
    o fixed bug in theoph.Rmd vignette to properly calculate the NOMTIME.
    o update theoph.Rmd and sad_pkpd.Rmd vignette to use TIME and NOMTIME both for confidence interval plots that overlay data

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.3
-------------------------
    o datasets are now visible to R-3.6 but this may break functionality for R-3.4
